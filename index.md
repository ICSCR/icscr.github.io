## Welcome to International Conference of Semantic Computing Resource 2019 (ICSCR 2019)

ICSC Resource is an appropriate venue to publish datasets, machine learning models, indexes, benchmarks, ontologies, libraries, APIs and tools that demand a high effort to be developed and can have a high impact on advancing the state of the art of semantic technologies.
Papers describing resources rarely receive the same recognition as research papers, therefore ICSC Resource will start to consider such works as well. The main requirements for resource papers are: (I) an objective but precise description of the resource; (II) an open license; and (III) to make the resource available to other users through a permanent link.


### Review Criteria

#### Availability
Is the resource publicly available through a DOI or permanent link (e.g., https://figshare.com, https://w3id.org)?
Is the resource backed by an open-source license (e.g., creativecommons.org, opensource.org)?

#### Impact
Is the resource relevant to the community?
Does the resource have a practical use?
Does the resource help to (re)evaluate approaches and/or perform research tasks?
Does the resource follow existing best practices (e.g., use a human- and machine-readable format in case of a dataset, reuse upper schemata in the case of an ontology)?
Can the resource be used to improve the state of the art?
 
#### Usability
Is the resource published with a reasonable documentation that provides an easy understanding on how to use the resource?
Is the resource easy to use?


### Submission details

Papers must have between 4 and 8 pages, be written in English and follow the instructions in the Manuscript Formatting and Templates page.
