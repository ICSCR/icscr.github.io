## Welcome to the 14th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing – Resource Track (ICSCR 2020)

ICSC Resource is an appropriate venue to publish datasets, machine learning models, indexes, benchmarks, ontologies, libraries, APIs and tools that demand a high effort to be developed and can have a high impact on advancing the state of the art of semantic technologies.
Papers describing resources rarely receive the same recognition as research papers, therefore ICSC Resource will start to consider such works as well. The main requirements for resource papers are: (I) an objective but precise description of the resource; (II) an open license; and (III) to make the resource available to other users through a permanent link.

This year, we are particularly encouraging ontologies and RDF dataset submissions available through [KBox](https://github.com/AKSW/KBox).

### Review Criteria

#### Availability
* Is the resource publicly available through a DOI or permanent link (e.g., [https://figshare.com](https://figshare.com), [https://w3id.org](https://w3id.org))?
* Is the resource backed by an open-source license (e.g., [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org), [opensource.org](https://opensource.org))?

#### Impact
* Is the resource relevant to the community?
* Does the resource have a practical use?
* Does the resource help to (re)evaluate approaches and/or perform research tasks?
* Does the resource follow existing best practices (e.g., use a human- and machine-readable format in case of a dataset, reuse upper schemata in the case of an ontology)?
* Can the resource be used to improve the state of the art?
 
#### Usability
* Is the resource published with a reasonable documentation that provides an easy understanding on how to use the resource?
* Is the resource easy to use?

### Submission details
Papers must have between 4 and 8 pages, be written in English and follow the instructions in the Manuscript Formatting and Templates page.
